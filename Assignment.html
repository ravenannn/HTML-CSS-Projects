			<h3>3 Easy changes you can make today -</h3>
			<p>1: Wash Clothes in Cold Water. Much of the energy used to wash clothing is spent on heating the water. 2: Switch to all natural cleaners. Use vinegar, baking soda, and other natural cleaning solutions instead of conventional cleaners. 3: Go paper-free. Cancel your newspaper subscription and subscribe to the online version instead. Send Evites instead of paper invitations. Use email instead of the fax machine.</p>
