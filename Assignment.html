			<h3><em>3 Easy changes you can make today -</em></h3>
			<p>1: Wash Clothes in Cold Water. Much of the energy used to wash clothing is spent on heating the water. 2: Switch to all natural cleaners. Use vinegar, baking soda, and other natural cleaning solutions instead of conventional cleaners. 3: Go paper-free. Cancel your newspaper subscription and subscribe to the online version instead. Send Evites instead of paper invitations. Use email instead of the fax machine.</p>

			<h1>Real Gardeners, Real Climate Action</h1>
			
			<p>Even if you’re not a farmer or a corporate CEO, you can take part in the effort to regenerate our soil and reverse climate change. All you have to do is garden. <br>

			Americans planted Victory Gardens during WWI and WWII to feed their communities and families at home, as part of supporting the war effort. (That way, more food from farms went overseas to feed soldiers.) By 1944, nearly 20 million Victory Gardens produced nearly 8 million tons of food.<br>

			Green America is asking Americans to garden for the common good once more. By planting what we call a Climate Victory Garden, all of us have the opportunity to use our gardens to fight global warming. 
			To grow a Climate Victory Garden, all you have to do is shift to regenerative gardening practices. You’ll regenerate the soil in your corner of the country, allowing it to sequester more carbon.

		<!--ADDING A DETAILS TAG WITH SUMMARY-->
		<summary>Fish and Human Health</summary>
		<details>The health benefits of eating seafood are considerable:<br>

				Seafood is low in fat and calories.<br>
				It’s a great source of high-quality protein.<br>
				Omega-3 oils, which occur in abundance in mackerel, albacore tuna, salmon, herring, sardines, and lake trout—for their abundance of omega-3 oils. Omega-3s help prevent blood clots, promote a healthy heart, and may even help alleviate rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and depression.<br>
				Despite its benefits, seafood can be dangerous to your health when contaminated with industrial chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals—most notably mercury and PCBs—which has too often been shown to be the case in recent studies.
